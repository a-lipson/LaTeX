\begin{problem}
$a_n > 0,\, \sum a_n$ converges $\implies \sum \frac{1}{n}\left( a_n + a_{n+1} + \cdots + a_{2n}\right)$ converges.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	% We wish to show that $\sum \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=n }^{2n} a_k$ also converges using the Dirichlet test for convergence.
	We will show that the series converges using the Dirichlet test.

	Note that we can express the sum inside the series as a difference of partial sums of $a_n$, \[
		% \sum_{k=n }^{2n} a_k = S_{2n}-S_{n-1}
		a_n + a_{n+1} + \cdots + a_{2n} = S_{2n}-S_{n-1}
		,\] where $S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_n$.

	So, the given series can be written as, \[
		\sum \frac{1}{n} \left( S_{2n}-S_{n-1}\right)
		.\]

	We will now show that $S_{2n}-S_{n-1}$ is uniformly bounded for all $n$.

	Since $S_n$ converges, then it must be bounded.
	So, there exists some  $M$ such that,  $|S_n|\le M$ for all $n$.

	Then, we have that $|S_{2n}|\le M$ and $|S_{n-1}|\le M$ as well.

	Thus, by the triangle inequality,  \[
		|S_{2n}-S_{n-1}|\le |S_{2n}| + |S_{n-1}| \le 2M
		.\]

	So, $S_{2n}-S_{n-1}$ is uniformly bounded for all $n$.

	% Since $\sum a_n$ converges, then its sequence of partial sums $S_n$ is Cauchy. \\
	% So, for all $\epsilon$, there exists an $N$ such that, for all  $m > n > N$, \[
	% 	|S_m-S_n| < \epsilon
	% 	.\]
	% Particularly, for large $N$, we have  \[
	% 	|S_{2n}-S_{n-1}|\le \epsilon
	% 	.\]
	% Since $S_n$ converges to  $S$, the difference $S_{2n}-S_{n-1}$ is bounded by an arbitrarily small $\epsilon$ as $n \to \infty$.

	Since $\frac{1}{n} \to 0$ as $n\to \infty$ and $S_{2n}-S_{n-1}$ is uniformly bounded for all $n$, then  \[
		\sum \frac{1}{n} \left( S_{2n}-S_{n-1}\right) = \sum \frac{1}{n} \left( a_n+a_{n+1}+\cdots+a_{2n} \right)
	\] converges by the Dirichlet test.
\end{proof}
