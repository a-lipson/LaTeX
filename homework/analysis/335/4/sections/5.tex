\begin{problem}
Let $f(x)=\sum_{0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$ with radius of convergence $R>0$.
For all $x$ in the radius of convergence, show that
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*)]
	\item $f(-x)=f(x)$, $f$ even iff $\forall a_n = 0$ when $n$ is odd, and
	\item $f(-x)=-f(x)$,  $f$ odd iff  $\forall a_n = 0$ when $n$ is even.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Note that even functions satisfy $f(-x)=f(x)$ and have only even powers.

	If $a_n$ for all  $n$ odd, then the series must only have even powers.
	So, by definition, the series must be an even function satisfying $f(-x)=f(x)$.

	Similarly,  $f(-x)=-f(x)$ for odd functions, which only have odd powers.

	If  $a_n=0$ for all even  $n$, then the series must have only odd powers, so it must be an odd function where $f(-x)=-f(x)$ is satisfied.
\end{proof}
