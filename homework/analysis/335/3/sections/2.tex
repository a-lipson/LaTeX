\begin{problem}
Test for absolute and uniform convergence.
State the intervals of convergence.
Check for the continuity of the sum.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*)]
	\item $\sum_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n^2 + n + 1}$.
	\item $\sum_{1}^{\infty} \frac{ \cos{nx}  }{n^3}$.
	\item $\sum_{1}^{\infty} n^{-x}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of i]
	Let $f_n(x)=\frac{x^n}{{(n+1)}^2}$.
	Then, $\forall |x|\le 1,\, |f_n(x)|\le \frac{1}{{(n + 1)}^2}$.

	Since $\sum_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{{(n + 1)}^2}$ converges, then $f_n$ will converge absolutely and uniformly by Weierstrass.

	Since  $f_n \rightrightarrows f$ and $f_n$ is a polynomial and therefore continuous, then  $f$ is continuous by Theorem 7.8.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of ii]
	Note that, \[
		\forall x \in \R,\, \left| \frac{\cos{nx} }{n^3} \right| \le \frac{1}{n^3}
		.\]

	Since $\sum \frac{1}{n^3} $ converges, then (ii) will converge absolutely and uniformly by Weierstrass.

	Since (ii) converges uniformly and  $\frac{\cos{nx} }{n^3}$ is continuous for all $n$, then the sum  is also continuous by Theorem 7.8.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of iii]
	We need $n^{-x}\to 0$ as $n\to \infty$.
	This occurs when $x>1$ by comparison to  \[
		\int_{1}^{\infty} x^{-p} \,dx
		,\] which converges $\forall x > 1$ and $p > 1$.

	So, we have that (iii) converges when $x>1$.
	Then, $\left|n^{-x}\right| = \frac{1}{n^{x}} \to  0$ as $n\to \infty$, we also have that (iii) converges absolutely and uniformly by Weierstrass.

	Since we have uniform converge and  $n^{-x}$ is continuous for all $n,x$, then the sum is also continuous by Theorem 7.8.
\end{proof}
