\begin{problem}
The family of mappings introduced here plays an important role in complex
analysis.
These mappings, sometimes called \textbf{Blaschke factors}, will reappear in
various applications in later chapters.
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item Let $z,w$ be two complex numbers such that  $\overline{z} w \neq 1$.
	      Prove that \[
		      \left| \frac{w-z}{1-\overline{w}z} \right| <1\quad \text{if } |z|<1 \text{ and } |w| < 1
		      ,\] and also that \[
		      \left| \frac{w-z}{1-\overline{w}z} \right| =1\quad \text{if } |z|=1 \text{ or } |w| = 1
		      .\]
	      [Hint: Why can one assume that $z$ is real?
	      It then suffices to prove that  \[
		      (r-w)(r-\overline{w})\le (1-rw)(1-r\overline{w})
	      \] with equality appropriate for $r$ and  $|w|$.]
\end{enumerate}
\item Prove that for a fixed $w$ in the unit disc  $\D$, the mapping \[
	F: z \mapsto \frac{w-z}{1-\overline{w}z}
\] satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
	\item $F$ maps the unit disc to itself (that is, $F:\D \to \D$), and is holomorphic.
	\item $F$ interchanges 0 and $w$, namely $F(0)=w$ and $F(w)=0$.
	\item $|F(z)| = 1$ if $|z| = 1$.
	\item $F:\D \to \D$ is bijective.
		      [Hint: Calculate $F \circ F$]
\end{enumerate}
