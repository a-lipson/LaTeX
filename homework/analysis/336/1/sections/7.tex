\begin{problem}
Show that if $|a|<r|b|$, then  \[
	\int_{\gamma}\frac{1}{(z-a)(z-b)}dz = \frac{2\pi i}{a-b}
	,\] where $\gamma$ denotes the circle centered at the origin, of radius $r$, with the positive orientation.
% note that the previous parts of this question in the textbook have that, for all integers n (except n=-1), the integral about a circular path anywhere in the complex plane is zero; at n=-1, the integral of a circular path about the origin is 2 pi i.
