\begin{problem}
In this problem we will go through a proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,
that is: If \[
	p(z)=a_n z^n + \cdots + a_0
\] is a polynomial with an $a_n\neq 0$, then there exists $z_0\in \C$ such that $p(z_0)=0$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $p(z) \neq 0$ for all $z \in \C$. Show that the function $g(z) = |p(z)|$ has a minimum at some point $z_0\in \C$. (Hint: Remember that $\C$ is definitely not compact!)
	\item Consider the function $q(z)=\frac{1}{|p(z_0)|}p(z+z_0)$.
	      Show that $q$ is a polynomial with $q(0) = 1$ and that $|q(z)|$ has its minimum at $z = 0$.
	\item Show that for any sufficiently small $\epsilon>0$, there is some $\theta$ for which $|q(\epsilon e^{i\theta})|<1$, which provides the desired contradiction.
\end{enumerate}
