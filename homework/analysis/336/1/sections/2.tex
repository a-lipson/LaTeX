\begin{problem}
With $\omega = se^{i\varphi}$, where $s\ge 0$ and $\varphi \in \R$, solve the equation $z^n = \omega$ in $\C$ where $n$ is a natural number.
How many solutions are there?
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $z=re^{i\theta}$.
	Then, $z^n = r^n e^{in\theta} = se^{i\varphi}$.
	So, we have $r^n = s$ and  $n\theta = \varphi+2\pi k,\, k\in \Z$.

	WLOG, let $\varphi=0$ because we can rotate both vectors such that  $\omega$ lies on the positive real axis.
	In any case, we are looking for solutions to $n\theta-\varphi=0$ with the following constraint on $\theta$: \[
		\theta < 2\pi \implies \theta = \frac{\varphi+2\pi k}{n}<2\pi
		.\]
	Since this holds for $k=0,\ldots,n-1$ until $k=n \implies \theta = 2\pi \not< 2\pi$, then we have $n$ solutions of $\theta$.
\end{proof}
