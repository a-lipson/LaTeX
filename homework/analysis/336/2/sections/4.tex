Let $u: \D \to \R$. Suppose $u\in \C$ and $\Delta u(x,y)=0$ for all $(x,y)\in \D$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Prove that there exists a holomorphic function on the unit disk such that $\re(f)=u$.
	      Show that the imaginary part of $f$ is defined up to an additive real constant.
	      % Hint: f'(z)=2 \partial u / \partial z. Let g(z)=2 \partial u / \partial z, 
	      % and prove that g is holomorphic. 
	      % Why can we find a primitive F of g such that F' = g?- 
	      % Prove that Re(F) differs from u by a real constant. 
	\item Deduce the Poisson integral representation formula from the Cauchy integral formula.
	      If $u$ is harmonic in the unit disk and continuous on its closure, then, with $z=re^{i\theta}$, \[
		      u(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi} P_r(\theta-\varphi)u(\varphi) \,d\varphi
	      \] where $P_r(\gamma)$ is the Poisson kernel for the unit disk given by  \[
		      P_r(\gamma) = \frac{1-r^2}{1-2r\cos{\theta}+r^2}
		      .\]
