\begin{problem}
Analytic functions on the unit disk that cannot be extended analytically past the unit circle.
\begin{definition}[regular]
	Let $f$ be defined on the unit disk  $\D$ with boundary circle $C$.
	A point $w$ on $C$ is regular for $f$ if there is an open neighborhood $U$ of $w$
	and an analytic function $g$ on $U$ such that $f=g$ on $\D\cap U$.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
	A function $f$ defined on $\D$ cannot be continued analytically past the unit circle if no point of $C$ is regular for $f$.
\end{lemma}
Let  \[
	f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} z^{2^{n}}, \quad \forall |z|<1
	.\]
Note that the radius of convergence is 1.
Show that $f$ cannot be analytically continued past the unit disk.
% Hint Suppose θ = 2πp/2^k, where p and k are positive integers.
% Let z = re^{iθ}; then |f(re^iθ)|→∞ as r → 1.
