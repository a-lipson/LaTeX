\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be the graph whose vertex set is $\{0,1\}^n$, with an edge between $x$ and $y$ if $x$ and $y$ differ at exactly two positions. How many connected components does $G$ have?
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Each vertex in $G$ can be represented by an  $n$-bit binary string.
	Such strings haves either an even or odd parity, given by an even or odd number of 1s respectively.
	Note that flipping two bits does not change the parity of a string.

	We claim that $G$ is bipartite between even and odd parity vertices.

	We can reach every vertex in each subgraph by flipping any two bits and maintaining parity.

	Thus, each parity class subgraph forms a connected component as adding any vertex of opposing parity would make the graph disconnected as there is no way to reach opposing parity by flipping two bits.

	Since there are two parity subgraphs, each of which is connected, then $G$ has two connected components.
\end{proof}
