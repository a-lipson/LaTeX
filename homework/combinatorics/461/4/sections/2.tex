\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be the graph whose vertex set is $\{0,1\}^n$, with an edge between $x$ and $y$ if $x$ and $y$ differ at exactly one position.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the degree of each vertex of $G$?
	\item How many edges does $G$ have?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of a]
	There are $n$ ways that a vertex in  $\{0,1\}^n$ can change by one position, so each vertex in $G$ must have degree  $n$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of b]
	Note that there are $|\{0,1\}^n| = 2^n$ vertices in $G$.
	Then, by the handshake Lemma, we have, for all vertices $v$ and edge set $E$, \[
		2^n \deg{v} = 2|E| => n2^{n-1} = |E|
		.\]
	So there are $n 2^{n-1}$ edges in $G$.
\end{proof}
