For each positive integer $n$, how many ways can you write $n$ as a sum of positive integers, if the order of the sum matters? For example, for $n=4$ there are 8 ways: $4$, $3+1$, $1+3$, $2+2$, $2+1+1$, $1+2+1$, $1+1+2$, and $1+1+1+1$.
\begin{proof}
	We will establish a bijection between a set with size $2^{n-1}$ and the number of ways to produce the sums described above.

	First, we will describe the domain set;
	consider $n$ ``stars'' with $n-1$ gaps.

	In each gap, insert either a comma or a plus; e.g.,
	\[
		*\ \ *\ \ *\ \ * \ \to\ * + * + * \, ,\, *
		.\]

	This gives $n-1$ independent choices of 2, or  $2^{n-1}$.

	Now, consider each star to represent 1, grouping all stars connected by pluses into larger integers; e.g.,
	\[
		* + * + * \, ,\, * \ \to 3, 1
		.\]

	This will produce an ordered list of terms which sum to $n$ where $n-1,1$ is different than $1,n-1$.

	Now, we will show that this is a bijection to our desired set of sums by describing the inverse.

	With an ordered sum of $n$, replace all addition with commas; e.g.,
	\[
		3+1 \to  3,1
		.\]

	Then represent all integers greater than 1 with stars and pluses, and all 1s with stars; e.g.,
	\[
		3,1 \to  * + * + * \, ,\, *
		.\]

	Since we have arrived at our domain set once more, we have established an inverse mapping and therefore shown that our original construction was a bijection.

	Since our map is a bijection with a domain cardinality of $2^{n-1}$, then the number of ways to write $n$ as a sum of positive integers where order matters is also  $2^{n-1}$.
