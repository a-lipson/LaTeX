\begin{problem}
Let $G = (V,E)$ be a connected graph with a weighting $w : E \to \bb R_{\ge 0}$ on its edges. Prove that every minimum spanning tree of $G$ has the same multiset of edge weights.
% \emph{Hint:} Use the previous problem.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $T=(V,E)$ and  $T=(V,E')$ are two different minimum spanning trees (MST) of $G$.
	Then, they differ by at least one edge.
	Let  $e\in E\setminus E'$ and $e'\in E'\setminus E$.

	WE must be able to pick such edges since $T$ and  $T'$ both span  $G$,
	otherwise $T=T'$, so there is only one spanning which must already be minimum with one multiset.

	By the announcement, both $T-e+e'$ and  $T'-e'+e$ are spanning trees of  $G$.

	Since  $T$ and $T'$ are both MSTs, then they must both have the same total weight, call it  $w$.  \[
		w(E)=w(E')=w
		.\]
	The new spanning trees cannot have a smaller weight than the MST weight $w$, otherwise $T$ and  $T'$ would not have been MSTs.
	So, we have  \[
		w(E)\le w(E-e+e')=w(E)-w(e)+w(e')\implies w(e)\le w(e')
		.\]
	We also have \[
		w(E')\le w(E'-e'+e)=w(E')-w(e')+w(e)\implies w(e')\le w(e)
		.\]
	Thus,  \[
		w(e)=w(e')
		.\]
	Hence, whenever $T$ and  $T'$ differ by an edge, the differing edges must have the same weight.
	Repeating this for all differing edges implies that  $T$ and  $T'$ share the same multiset of weights.

	Since  $T$ and  $T'$ were arbitrary MSTs, then every MST of  $G$ must have the same multiset of edge weights.
