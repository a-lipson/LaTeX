\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be a bipartite graph with bipartition $\{X,Y\}$. Suppose every vertex of $G$ has the same degree. Prove that $|X| = |Y|$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Since each vertex has the same degree, call it $d$, then the sum of the degrees in  $X$ is  $d|X|$.
	Since  $G$ is bipartite, then every vertex in  $X$ has an edge to a vertex in  $Y$.  \[
		N(X)=Y
		.\]
	Hence, the total number of edges is exactly this count, \[
		|E| = d|X|
		.\]
	By the same reasoning, $N(Y)=X\implies |E| = d|Y|$, which counts the same edges as before, just from the other side.

	Thus,  \[
		d|X| = |E| = d|Y| \implies |X| = |Y|
		.\]
\end{proof}
