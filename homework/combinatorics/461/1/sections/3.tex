You are arranging a collection of $n$ different books on a bookshelf. Among these books are The Lord of the Rings 1, 2, and 3.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How many ways are there to arrange the books if The Lord of the Rings books must be next to each other, in the correct order?
	      \\\\
	      Consider the three adjacent ordered LOTR books to be one unit. Then, there are $(n-2)!$ was to arrange the books while preserving the LOTR unit.
	      \\
	\item How many ways are there to arrange the books if The Lord of the Rings books must be next to each other, but not necessarily in the correct order?
	      \\\\
	      Consider the result from (a), then multiply by the $3! = 6$ permutations of the three LOTR books. This gives a $6(n-2)!$.
	      \\
	\item How many ways are there to arrange the books if The Lord of the Rings books must be in the correct order, but not necessarily next to each other?
	      \\\\
	      First, we will choose 3 spots from the $n$ possible to place the LOTR books in order. This is $\binom{n}{3}$.
	      Then, we will arrange the $n-3$ remaining books. We have  $(n-3)!$ ways to do so.
	      Thus, the total permutation count is the product of these independent actions, $\binom{n}{3}(n-3)!$.
