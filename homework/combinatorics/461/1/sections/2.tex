A class of 28 students is divided into seven teams of four for a group assignment.
In addition, in each team one person is designated to be the leader.
How many ways can the teams and leaders be assigned? (Assume all teams are doing the same assignment.)
\\\\
There are $28!$ arrangements of students
Yet, we must also choose one leader from each of the groups, there are $4^7$ ways to do this.
But, we can swap students inside of each of the seven groups; there are  $4!^7$ ways to do this.
We can also swap the groups themselves; there are  $7!$ ways to do this.

So, multiplying by the first two independent choices and dividing by the ways we achieve equivalent choices through swaps, we find the total count is \[
	\frac{28!4^7}{4!^7 7!}=\frac{28!}{3!^7 7!}=\frac{28!}{6^7 7!}\approx 2.16\cdot 10^{20}
	.\]
