\begin{problem}
\item A polyhedron has 26 faces, 20 of which are triangles and 6 of which are quadrilaterals. Find the number of vertices and edges of this polyhedron.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	We have that, \[
		2E = \sum_{f\in F} \text{length}(f) = 20\cdot 3 + 6\cdot 4 = 84 \implies E = 42
		.\]

	Then, by Euler's formula, \[
		V-E+F = V-42+26=2 \implies V = 18
		.\]
\end{proof}
