\begin{problem}
Modify Euler's formula so that it holds for any planar graph, not just connected planar graphs. Prove your formula.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Since $G$ is planar and not connected, then $G$ has $k$ connected components.

	We can connect align these components in a row and connect them with $k-1$ edges.

	Now, the new graph is connected and planar, so $V-(E+(k-1))+F=2$ holds.

	Hence, we have $V-E+F=3-k$ for a disconnected planar graph of  $k$ connected components.
\end{proof}
