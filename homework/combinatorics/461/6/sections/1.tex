\begin{problem}
Let $G$ be a graph with bipartition $\{X,Y\}$. Suppose that every vertex in $X$ has degree $a$, and every vertex in $Y$ has degree $b$, and $a \ge b \ge 1$. Prove there is a matching of $G$ such that every element of $X$ is covered.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	We wish to show that $\forall S\subset X,\, |S| \le |N(S)|$.

  Consider any $S\subset X$. 
  The number of edges from $S$ is  $a|S| $. 

  These edges go into the vertices $N(S)\subset Y$, which have at most $b|N(S)|$ edges. 
  So, $a|S| \le b|N(S)|$. 

	Since $1\le b\le a$, then we have $b / a \le 1$ and $|S| / |N(S)| \le b / a \le 1$, 
  which means that $|S| \le |N(S)|$.

  Since this holds for any $S\subset X$, then, by Hall's Theorem, we must have a matching covering $X$. 
\end{proof}

	% We will count the number of edges in $G$ in two ways.
	% Since every vertex in $Y$ has degree $b$, then we must have $b|Y|$ edges.
	% Since every vertex in $Y$ has degree $a$, then we must have $a|X|$ edges.
	%
	% So, $a|X| = b|Y| \implies |X| / |Y| = b / a$.
	% Since $a\ge b\ge 1$, we have $b / a \le 1$, which means that $|X| \le |Y| $.
