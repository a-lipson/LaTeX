Suppose that $f$ is differentiable with $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, and suppose that $f(1) = 0$. 
Set \[F(x) = \int_{0}^{x} f(t)dt.\]

Justify each statement and make a rough sketch of the graph of $F$.

\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item $F$ is continuous.
    
    Since $f$ is differentiable, it is continuous. Then, by 5.3.5, $F$ is also continuous.

    \item $F$ is twice differentiable.
    
    Since $F'(x)=f(x)$ by 5.3.5 and $f$ is differentiable, then $F''(x)=f'(x)$. So, $F$ is twice differentiable.

    \item $x = 1$ is a critical point for $F$.
    
    Since $F'=f$ and $f(1)=0$, then $x=1$ is a critical number of $F$. 

    \item $F$ takes on a local minimum at $x = 1$.

    Since $F''(x)=f'(x)$ and $f'(x)>0$ for all $x>0$, then all critical points on $F$ will be local minima by the second derivate test.

    \item $F(1) < 0$.

    Since $f'(x)>0$ for all $x>0$, then $f$ is strictly increasing.

    % So, $f$ cannot be a constant function on $[0,1]$.

    Since $f(1)=0$, then $f(x)<0$ for all $x<1$.

    Since $F'(x)=f(x)$ and $f(x)<0$ for all $x<1$, then $F(x)$ is strictly decreasing when $x<1$.

    Since $F$ is strictly decreasing when $x<1$ and $F(0)=\int_{0}^{0} f(t)dt=0$, then $F(1)<0$.

    % Then, for $F(1)=\int_{0}^{1} f(t) dt$, with $f(t)<0$ for $t\in[0,1]$, we see that $F(1)<0$

\end{enumerate}

We can produce a simple sketch around the interval $(0,1)$ using the data that $F(0)=0$; and that $F$ is strictly decreasing until $F(1)$, which is a local minima.

\subsection*{36}
Let $f$ be everywhere continuous and set 
\[F(x)=\int_{0}^{x} t \left[ \int_{1}^{t} f(u) du \right] dt.\]

Find each of the following,

\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*)]
    \item $F'(x)$
    
    By 5.3.5, $F'(x) = x \int_{1}^{x} f(u) du$.

    \item $F'(1)$
    
    Since $F'(1) = x \int_{1}^{1} f(u) du = x \cdot 0$ by 5.3.4, then $F'(1) = 0$.

    \item $F''(x)$
    
    Again, by 5.3.5,
    \begin{align*}
        F''(x) &= \int_{1}^{x} f(u) du + x \frac{d}{dx} \left[ \int_{1}^{x} f(u) du \right] \\
        &= \int_{1}^{x} f(u) du + x f(x). \\
    \end{align*}

    \item $F''(1)$
    
    $F''(1) = 0 + 1 \cdot f(1)$ by 5.3.4. So, $F''(1)=f(1)$.

\end{enumerate}
