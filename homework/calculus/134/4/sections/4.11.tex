\subsection*{20}
View the earth as a sphere of radius 4000 miles. The volume
of ice that covers the north and south poles is estimated to
be 8 million cubic miles. Suppose that this ice melts and the
water produced distributes itself uniformly over the surface
of the earth. Estimate the depth of this water.

First, we find the volume of the earth.
\[V_E = \frac{4}{3}\pi{(4000)}^3=\frac{256}{3}\pi\cdot10^9\]

Then, we find the radius of the sphere comprised of the total volume of both the earth and all of its melted ice. 
\begin{align*}
    \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 &= \frac{256}{3}\pi\cdot10^9 + 8\cdot10^6 \\
    r^3 &= \frac{3}{4\pi} \left( \frac{256}{3}\pi\cdot10^9 + 8\cdot10^6 \right) \\
    r^3 &= 64\cdot10^9 + \frac{6\cdot10^6}{\pi} \\
    r = \sqrt[3]{64\cdot10^9 + \frac{6\cdot10^6}{\pi}} \\
    r \approx 4000.04 \\
\end{align*}

Finally, we find the height of the ice by taking the radius of the earth from $r$, the earth and melted ice radius. 
\[4000.04-4000 = 0.04\]

So, the added depth of water covering the earth would be about 0.04 miles or around 211 feet.
