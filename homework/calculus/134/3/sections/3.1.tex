Let $f(x) = \begin{cases}
    x\sin{\frac{1}{x}}, & x \neq 0 \\
    0, & x = 0 
\end{cases}$ and $g(x) = xf(x)$

(a) Show that $f$ and $g$ are both continuous at 0.

(b) Show that $f$ is not differentiable at 0.

(c) Show that $g$ is differentiable at 0 and give $g'(0)$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of (a).]
    We say that $h$ is continuous at $c$ if \[\lim\limits_{x \to c} h(x) = h(c).\]

    This requires that $\lim\limits_{x \to c^-} h(x) = \lim\limits_{x \to c^+} h(x)$

    First, for $f$, 
    \[\lim\limits_{x \to 0^0} f(x) = \lim\limits_{x \to 0^0} x\sin{\frac{1}{x}} = 0\]
    which was proven by the Squeeze theorem in a previous assignment.

    Since $f(0) = 0 = \lim\limits_{x \to 0} f(x)$, then $f$ is continuous.

    For $g$, \[\lim\limits_{x \to 0} g(x) = \lim\limits_{x \to 0} x^2\sin{\frac{1}{x}} = \lim\limits_{x \to 0} \]

\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of (b).]
    For a contradiction, assume $f$ is differentiable at 0. 

\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of (c).]
    By 3.1.5, \[g'(0) = \lim\limits_{x \to 0} \frac{g(x)-0}{x-0} = \lim\limits_{x \to 0} \frac{g(x)}{x} = \lim\limits_{x \to 0} x\sin{\frac{1}{x}} = 0.\]
\end{proof}
