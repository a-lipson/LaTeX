Show that $e^{t^2}$ is not of exponential order.

Since $t^2>at$ for all $t>a>0$,

Then, $e^{t^2}>e^{at}$ for all $t>a>0$.

Since $e^x>0$ for all $x$, then $e^x=|e^x|$ for all $x$.

So $\Big|e^{t^2}\Big|>e^{at}$ for all $t>a>0$.

Since $a>0$, then $e^{t^2}$ is not of exponential order as it is the negation of the definition for some $f$ of exponential order that $|f(x)|\leq Ae^{bt}$ for $b>0$.
