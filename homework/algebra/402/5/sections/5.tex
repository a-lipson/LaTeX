Determine if the given polynomial is irreducible.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	\item $x^2-7$ in $\R[x]$. \\
	      The difference of squares gives that $ \pm \sqrt{7}$ is a root. Therefore the polynomial is reducible in $\R[x]$.
	\item $x^2-7$ in $\Q[x]$. \\
	      $\sqrt{7} \not\in \Q$, so the polynomial does not have rational roots, and is therefore irreducible.
	\item  $x^2 + 7$ in $\C[x]$. \\
	      By the difference of squares, $ \pm \sqrt{7i} $ is a root in $\C$ ; therefore the polynomial is reducible in $\C[x]$.
	\item $2x^3 + x^2 + x + 2$ in $\Z_5[x]$. \\
	      Note that $2x^3 + x^2 + x + 2 = 2(x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + x)$ in $\Z_5[x]$.
	      This polynomial is $2(x+1)^3$ by the binomial expansion.
	      Since the polynomial factors as $2(x+1)^3$, it is reducible.
	\item $x^3-9$ in $\Z_{11}[x]$. \\
	      Note that $4^3-9= 64-9 = 55 = 0$ in $\Z_{11}$.
	      So, $x=4$ is a rational root.
	      Since the polynomial has a rational root, it is reducible.
	\item $x^4+x^2+1$ in $\Z_3[x]$. \\
	      We have a rational root at $x=1$ as  $1^4+1^2+1 = 3 = 0$ in  $\Z_3$.
	      Since the polynomial has a rational root, then it is reducible.
\end{enumerate}
