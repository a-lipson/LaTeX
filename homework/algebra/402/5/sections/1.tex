\begin{problem}
Find all irreducible polynomials of the given degree in the given field.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	\item Degree 2 in $\Z_2[x]$.
	\item Degree 3 in $\Z_2[x]$.
	\item Degree 2 in $\Z_3[x]$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of a]
	As given in lecture, we have $x^2 + x + 1$ as the only such irreducible polynomial.
	$x\cdot x = x^2$, $x(x+1)=x^2 + x$, and $(x + 1)^2=x^2 + 1$, which covers all $2^2=4$ possible polynomials of degree 2 in  $\Z_2[x]$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of b]
	We will consider the product of all combinations of irreducible linear factors $x$  and $x+1$.
	\[\begin{array}{r l}
			x\cdot x\cdot x             = & x^3,               \\
			(x)(x)(x+1)          =        & x^3 + x^2,         \\
			(x)(x+1)(x+1)       =         & x^3 + x,           \\
			(x+1)(x+1)(x+1)    =          & x^3 + x^2 + x + 1. \\
		\end{array}\]
	We have $x^3 + 1$, $x^3 + x + 1$, $x^3 + x^2 + x$, and $x^3 + x^2 + 1$ left over;
	these must be the irreducibles as we have covered all $2^3=8$ possible degree 3 polynomials in $\Z_2[x]$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of c ]
	We have $2\cdot 3^2=18$ possible polynomials of degree 2 in $\Z_3[x]$.
	We will first consider the polynomials with leading coefficient of 1.
	\[\begin{array}{r l}
			x\cdot x =   & x^2          \\
			(x)(x+1) =   & x^2 + x      \\
			(x)(x+2) =   & x^2 + 2x     \\
			(x+1)(x+1) = & x^2 + 2x + 1 \\
			(x+1)(x+2) = & x^2 +2       \\
			(x+2)(x+2)=  & x^2 +x  + 1  \\
		\end{array}\]

	Now, we are left with three remaining irreducible polynomials with leading coefficient of 1.
	These are $x^2 + x + 2$, $x^2 + 1$, and $x^2 + 2x + 2$.

	Since 2 is a unit in  $\Z_3$, we also have that the associate polynomials with leading coefficient 2 are irreducibles.
	So, we also have $2x^2 + 2x + 1$, $2x^2 + 2$, and $2x^2 + x + 1$.

	Thus, we have found 6 irreducibles and 12 reducibles for a total of 18 possible polynomials.
\end{proof}
