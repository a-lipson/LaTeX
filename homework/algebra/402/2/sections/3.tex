\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	\item Prove that $[a]$ unit in $\Z_n \implies [a]$ is not a zero divisor.
	\item Prove that $[a]$ zero divisor in $\Z_n \implies [a]$ is not a unit.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of a]
	For a contradiction, suppose that $[a]$ is both a unit and a zero divisor; \\
	$\exists x,y \in \Z_n,\, x,y\neq 0\ :\ ax=1,\, ay=0$.

	Then,
	\begin{align*}
		         & ax=ax+0=ax+ay=a(x+y) \\
		\implies & a(x+y)=ax            \\
		\implies & x+y = x              \\
		\implies & y = 0
		,\end{align*}
	which is a contradiction with the assumption that $ay=0$ had a nonzero solution.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of b]
	Follows from the contrapositive of (a).
\end{proof}
