\begin{problem}[10]
Define multiplication in $\Z$ by $\forall a,b\in \Z,\, ab=0$.
Show that, with ordinary addition and the new multiplication, $\Z$ is a commutative ring.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Since we are modifying the multiplication operation, we need to ensure that closure and associativity for multiplication and distributivity are maintained.

	Note that the multiplication operation maps all pairs of numbers in $\Z$ to $0\in \Z$, so the new multiplication operation is closed.

	For associativity, $a(bc) = a\cdot 0 = 0 = 0\cdot c = (ab)c$, so multiplication is associative.

	For distributivity, since $b+c\in \Z$ by the closure of addition already satisfied in $\Z$, then $a(b+c) = 0$ by the definition of the new multiplication operation.

	But,  $a(b+c)=ab+bc=0+0=0$, so the new multiplication satisfies distributivity.

	Since all axioms are maintained, $\Z$ is still a ring with the new multiplication operation.

	Since $\forall a,b\in \Z,\, ab=0=ba$, then $\Z$ with the new multiplication operation is also a commutative ring.
