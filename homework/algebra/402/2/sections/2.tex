Find all the units of
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	\item $\Z_7$
	      Since 7 is prime, all nonzero classes are units: $[1],\ldots,[6]$.
	\item $\Z_8$.
	      Since 1,3,5,7 are coprime to 8, then their classes from the units of $\Z_8$.
	\item $\Z_9$.
	      Since $1,2,4,5,7,8$ are coprime to 9, then their classes form the units of  $\Z_9$.
	\item  $\Z_{10}$.
	      Since $1,3,7$ are coprime to 10, then their classes form the units of  $\Z_{10}$.
\end{enumerate}
