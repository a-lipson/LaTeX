Prove or disprove: The set of units in a ring $R$ with identity is a subring of  $R$.
\end{problem}
This statement does not hold.

For an example, consider the ring $\Z$ with units $\{1,-1\} $. This set is not closed under addition, $1+(-1)=0\not\in \{1,-1\} $.
\begin{proposition}
	The set of units in a ring $R$ with identity cannot form a subring of  $R$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Recall the definition of a unit in $R$ with identity, $a\in R$ is a unit if it has an inverse in $R$.

	The units of  $R$ will never include 0 because 0 is not an inverse.
	So, this new subset of units will not be able to satisfy the additive identity axiom.

	Since the subset of units of $R$ does not contain zero, then it cannot satisfy the ring addition axioms and therefore is not a ring.

	So, the subset of units of  $R$ is not a subring of  $R$ either.
\end{proof}
