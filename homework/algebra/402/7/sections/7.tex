\begin{problem}
If $I$  and $J$  are ideals in $R$ , prove that $I\cap J$ is an ideal.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Both $I$ and  $J$ are nonempty, so there intersection is as well.

	Both  $I$ and  $J$ are closed under the addition operation of  $R$, so  $a\in I$ and $b\in J$ gives that $a+b$ must belong to both $I$ and $J$, and hence their intersection as well.

	Similarly, for multiplication.
\end{proof}
