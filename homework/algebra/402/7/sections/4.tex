Prove $\Q[\sqrt{2} ] \cong \Q[x]/(x^2-2)$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Define $\varphi:Q[x]\to Q[\sqrt{2} ]$ by $f(x)\mapsto f(\sqrt{2} )$.
	It follows quickly that $\varphi$ is homomorphic.

	Note that  $\ker{\varphi}=\{f(x)\in \Q[x]\ \mid\ f(\sqrt{2} )=0\} $.
	So, $x^2-2\in \ker{\varphi}$.

	Since $x^2-2$ is irreducible in $\Q[x]$ and $x^2-2$ is the minimal polynomial in $\Q[x]$ with root $\sqrt{2}$,
	then, by the same reasoning as in lecture, we have that \[
		(x^2-2)=\ker{\varphi}
		.\]

	Since for any $ a\sqrt{2}+b \in \Q[\sqrt{2} ] $, there is $ax+b\in \Q[x]$ such that $\varphi(ax+b)=a\sqrt{2}+b $, then $\varphi$ is surjective.

	Thus, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, since  $\varphi$ is epimorphic, then  \[
		\Q[\sqrt{2} ] \cong \Q[x]/(x^2-2)
		.\]
\end{proof}
