Prove $\R$ is isomorphic to the ring $S$ of  $2\times 2$ matrices of the form $\begin{pmatrix} a&0\\0&a \end{pmatrix},\, a\in \R$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	We will construct an isomorphism $f:\R\to S$.
	We will show that $f$ is a bijection and a homomorphism.

	First, let $f$ be defined by the map  \[
		a \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} a&0\\0&a \end{pmatrix}
		.\]
	Clearly, this is invertible $\left(  \begin{pmatrix} a&0\\0&a \end{pmatrix} \mapsto a \right) $.

	So, $f$ is a bijection.
	We can also write the map as $a \mapsto aI$, where $I$ is the  $2\times 2$ identity matrix.

	Now, we will consider the addition and multiplication operations under the image of the map.
	We have that, \[
		f(a+b)=(a+b)I = aI+bI = f(a)+f(b)
		.\]
	We also have that,
	\[
		f(ab)=abI = abI^2 = aI\,bI=f(a)f(b)
		.\]
	So, $f$ is a homomorphism.

	Since  $f$ is bijective and homomorphic, then  $f$ is an isomorphism.

	Since there exists the isomorphism  $f$ between $\R$ and $S$, then these rings are isomorphic.
