\begin{problem}
Let $\varphi:R[x]\to R$ be the function that maps each polynomial in $R[x]$ onto its constant term in $R$.
Prove  $\varphi$ is a surjective homomorphism of rings.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	First, we will show that $\varphi$ is surjective.

	$\forall r\in R,\, r\in R[x]$ as well. So, the entire codomain is covered by the map $\varphi$ from just the constant polynomials already in  $R[x]$.

	There are infinitely many polynomials with a given constant term  $r$,
	but we have that all such  $r\in R$ are covered as they belong in $R[x]$ as well.

	Next, we will show that  $\varphi$ is a homomorphism.

	Let  $f(x)=r+a_1x+\cdots+a_n x^n$ and $g(x)=s+b_1x+\cdots b_mx^m$.

	Then, for addition,
	\begin{align*}
		\varphi(f(x)+g(x)) & = \varphi(r + s + a_1 x + b_1 x + \cdots + b_m x^m + \cdots + a_n x^n) \\
		                   & = r+s                                                                  \\
		                   & = \varphi(r+a_1x+\cdots+a_n x^n)+\varphi(s+b_1x+\cdots b_mx^m)         \\
		                   & = \varphi(f(x))+\varphi(g(x))
		.\end{align*}

	For multiplication,
	\begin{align*}
		\varphi(f(x)g(x)) & = \varphi(a_n b_m x^{n+m}+ \cdots + a_1 b_1 x^2 + a_1 s x + b_1 r x + rs) \\
		                  & = rs                                                                      \\
		                  & = \varphi(r+a_1x+\cdots+a_n x^n)\varphi(s+b_1x+\cdots b_mx^m)             \\
		                  & = \varphi(f(x))\varphi(g(x))
		.\end{align*}

	So, $f$ is a homomorphism.

	Thus,  $f$ is a surjective homomorphism.
