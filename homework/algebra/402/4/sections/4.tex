\begin{problem}
Let $\Q(\sqrt{2})= \{r + s\sqrt{2}\ \mid\ r,s \in \Q  \} $.
Prove $f:\Q(\sqrt{2 } ) \to \Q(\sqrt{2 } )$ given by $a + b\sqrt{2 } \mapsto a-b\sqrt{2} $ is an isomorphism.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	We see that $f$ is invertible because we can simply flip the sign of the  $\sqrt{2} $ part.
	So, $f$ is a bijection.

	Let  $x=a + b\sqrt{2 } $ and $y=c+d\sqrt{2} $.

	We will show that $f$ is a homomorphism.

	For addition, \[
		f(x + y)
		= f((a + c) + (b + d)\sqrt{2} )
		= (a + c)-(b + d)\sqrt{2}
		= (a-b\sqrt{2})+(c-d\sqrt{2} )
		=f(x)+f(y)
		.\]

	For multiplication, \[
		f(xy)
		= f((ac+2bd)+(ad+bc)\sqrt{2} )
		= ac - ad\sqrt{2}-bc\sqrt{2}+2bd
		= (a-b\sqrt{2} )(c-d\sqrt{2} )
		=f(x)f(y)
		.\]

	So, $f$ is a homomorphism.

	Since  $f$ is a bijection and a homomorphism, then $f$ is an isomorphism.
