\begin{problem}
Define the homomorphism of rings $\varphi : \R[x] \to \R$ by $f(x)\mapsto f(2)$.
Find $\ker{\varphi} $.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	By Theorem 4.16 with the field $\R$, for $f(x)\in \R[x]$ and $a\in \R$,
	$a$ is a root of $f$ iff $x-a$ is a factor of  $f$.

	By definition, we have that $\ker{\varphi}=\{f(x) \in \R[x]\ \mid\ f(2)=0\}$,
	which is the set of polynomials in $\R[x]$ with a root at 2;
	these are the all polynomials of the form \[
		\ker{\varphi}= (x-2)g(x),\, \forall g(x)\in \R[x]
		.\]
\end{proof}
