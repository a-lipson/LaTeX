\begin{problem}
Let $F$ be a field, and $R$ a nonzero ring. Let $f:F\to R$ be an epimorphism.
Prove that $f$ is an isomorphism.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Since $f$ is an epimorphism, it is surjective and homomorphic.

	Let $K$ be the kernel of $f$.
	By Theorem 6.10, $K$ is an ideal in $F$.

	We will show that $K=0$, meaning that $f$ is injective and therefore an isomorphism.

	Since $F$ is a field, then the only ideals in $f$ are  $(0)$ and  $F$ itself.

	Suppose that $I$ is a nonzero ideal of  $F$.
	Then, for $a\in I$, for all $b\in F$, we have that $ab\in I$.
	Particularly, for $a^{-1}\in F$, we have that $1=aa^{-1}\in I \implies I = F$;
	so any nonzero ideal must be equal to $F$.

	If $K=F$, then  $f(F)=\{0\} \neq R$, a contradiction with the fact that $f$ is surjective.

	Thus we must have $K=0$, so  $f$ is injective.

	Since  $f$ is injective, surjective, and homomorphic, then $f$ is an isomorphism.
