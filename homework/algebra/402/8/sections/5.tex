Use the First Isomorphism Theorem to show that $\Z_{20} / (5) \cong \Z_5 $.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f:\Z_{20}\to \Z_5$ be a map with kernel $(5)$.

	We will show that  $f$ is surjective.

	Consider  $\ker{f}=(5)=\{x \in \Z_{20}\ \mid\ x\equiv 0 \mod{5}\}  $.

	Since $0,1,2,3,4 \in \Z_{20}$ are mapped to themselves in $\Z_5$ respectively by $f$,
	then all elements in the codomain $\Z_5$ are mapped by $f$,
	so $f$ is surjective.

	Thus, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, since $f$ is surjective, then \[
		\Z_{20} / (5) \cong \Z_5
		.\]
\end{proof}
