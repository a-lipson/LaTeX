\begin{problem}
Show that $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational for all positive prime integers $p$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	We will consider all $p>1$ because  $1=\sqrt{1}$ is a rational positive prime integer.

	Consider the polynomial $x^2-p$ which has roots $ \pm \sqrt{p} $.

	By the Rational Root Theorem,
	if $x^2-p$ has a rational root $q$, then it must be $ \pm p$ or $ \pm 1$.

	But, $( \pm p)^2-p \neq 0$ and $ ( \pm 1)^2-p\neq 0$ for all $p>1$.

	So,  $x^2-p$ has no rational roots,
	hence its roots $ \pm \sqrt{p} $ must not be rational.
\end{proof}
