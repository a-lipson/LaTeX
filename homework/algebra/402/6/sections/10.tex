\begin{problem}
Prove that, when $f(x)$ and $p(x)$ are coprime in $F[x]$, then $f(x)$ is a unit in $F[x]/(p(x))$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	This is Theorem 5.9.
	We wish to show that there exists a $g(x)\in F[x]$ such that $f(x)g(x)\equiv 1_F \mod{p(x)} $.

	By Theorem 4.8, since $(f(x),p(x))=1$, then there exist some $g(x),q(x)\in F[x]$ such that we have the linear combination $f(x)g(x)+p(x)q(x)=1$.

	Then, if we consider this equation in mod  $p(x)$, we have that  $f(x)g(x)\equiv 1 \mod{p(x)}$, so we are done.
\end{proof}
