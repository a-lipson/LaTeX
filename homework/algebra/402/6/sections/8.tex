List the distinct congruence classes of modulo $x^3 + x + 1$ in $\Z_2[x]$.
\end{problem}
We need to find all possible remainders when dividing by $x^3 + x + 1$ in $\Z_2[x]$,
these will have at most degree two.

There are $2^3=8$ such polynomials which will be the canonical representatives of the congruence classes:
$0,1,x,x + 1,x^2,x^2 + 1,x^2 + x,x^2 + x + 1$.
