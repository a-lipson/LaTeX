\begin{problem}
Show that polynomials of odd degree with no multiple roots in $\R[x]$
must have an odd number of real roots.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ must have $n$ roots in $\C[x]$.

	Since complex roots come in conjugate pairs for polynomials in $\R[x]$, then we must have an even number of such roots for the given polynomials.

	The number of real roots is the number of total roots, which is odd, take the number of complex  roots, which is even.
	Since odd - even = odd, then we must have an odd number of real roots.
\end{proof}
