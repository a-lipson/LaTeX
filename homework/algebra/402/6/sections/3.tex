\begin{problem}
Prove that for $p$ prime,  $f(x)=x^{p-1}+x^{p-2}+\cdots+x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible in $\Q[x]$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proposition}
	If $f(x+c)$ is irreducible over $F[x]$ $f(x)$, then so is $f(x)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition]
	We will prove the contrapositive.
	$f(x)$ is reducible in  $F[x]$ iff there is a root $a$ of $f$ such that  $f(a)=0$.

	Then,  for $x=a-c$, $f(a-c+c)=f(a)=0$ is a root of $f(x+c)$.

	Thus, $f(x+c)$ is reducible in $F[x]$ as well.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Problem]
	Note that \[
		(x-1)f(x)=x^p-1 \implies f(x)=  \frac{x^p-1}{x-1}
		.\]

	We will consider \[
		f(x+1)=\frac{(x+1)^p-1}{x}
		.\]

	By the binomial expansion, we have \[
		(x+1)^p = \sum_{0}^{p} \binom{p}{k} x^k \cdot 1^{p-k} = \sum_{0}^{p} \binom{p}{k} x^k
		.\]

	So, \[
		f(x+1)=\frac{1}{x}\left( \sum_{0}^{p} \binom{p}{k} x^k - 1 \right) = \sum_{1}^{p} \binom{p}{k} x^{k-1}
		.\]

	For $k=p$,  $\binom{p}{p} = 1$, so $p$ is coprime with the leading coefficient.

	Note that $\forall 0<k<p,\, p\mid \binom{p}{k}$.
	So, $p$ divides all the other coefficients.

	Then, at $k=1$, $\binom{p}{1} = p$ but $p^2\nmid p$.
	So, the conditions of Einstein's Criterion are satisfied.
	Thus, $f(x+1)$ is irreducible in  $\Q[x]$.

	Hence, by the Proposition, $f(x)$ is irreducible in  $\Q[x]$ as well.
\end{proof}
