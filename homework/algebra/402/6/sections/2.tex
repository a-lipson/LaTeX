Show that there are infinitely many integers $k$ such that $x^9+12x^5-21x+k$ is irreducible in  $\Q[x]$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	We wish to satisfy Einstein's Criterion in order to show that the given polynomial is irreducible in $\Q[x]$.

	We have that the leading coefficient of this polynomial is 1, which is coprime to all primes $p$.

	Then, we must have $p\mid 12$, $p\mid 21$, and $p\mid k$.
	Since $(12,21)=3$, then $p=3$.

	We need $p\mid k$ but not $p^2\mid k$.
	So, we must have $k=3^{2n+1},\, \forall n \in \Z_{\ge 0}$.
	This gives $3\mid 3^{2n+1}$ but not $3^2\mid 3^{2n+1}$ as desired.

	Thus, $f$ is irreducible over $\Q[x]$ by Einstein's Criterion,
	and there are infinitely many such $k$ of the form  $k=3^{2n+1},\, \forall n \in \Z_{\ge 0}$ which satisfy these conditions.
\end{proof}
