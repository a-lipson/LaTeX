\begin{problem}[5]
Prove $\forall n \in \Z_{>0},\, \frac{12n+1}{30n+2}$ cannot be reduced.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	We will show that the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator is one, indicating that the fraction is already in simplest form.
	\begin{align*}
		  & (30n+2,12n+1) \\
		= & (12n+1,6n)    \\
		= & (6n,1) = 1
		.\end{align*}
	So, the fraction $\frac{12n+1}{30n+2}$ is already in simplest form.
\end{proof}
