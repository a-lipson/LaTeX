Prove there are infinitely many primes.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	For a contraction, assume that there are $k$ finitely many primes $p_1,\ldots,p_k$.

	Let $n = 1 + \prod_{i_1}^k p_i$. Since the right term of $n$ has a factor of each prime,
	then $\forall i \in [1,k]$, \[
		n \equiv 1 \pmod{p_i}
		.\]

	Thus, $n$ is not divisible by any of the primes. So, $n$ must be a prime itself or have a prime factor not included in the finitely many $k$ primes.

	Since we have found a prime that is not in our original finite list, then our assumption must be false.

	Therefore, there must be infinitely many primes.
\end{proof}
