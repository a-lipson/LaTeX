\begin{problem}[10]
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	\item Show $\forall n \in \Z_{>0},\, 10^n\equiv 1 \pmod{9}$.
	\item Prove that every positive integer is congruent to the sum of its digits mod
	      9
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of a]
	See Problem 4.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of b]
	We can use the same expansion of $n$ by powers of ten as in Problem 4 without the condition that the original $n$ is divisible by 9.
	In such a case, we are still left with $n = a_0 10^0 + \cdots + a_k 10^k \equiv a_0 + \cdots + a_k \pmod{9}$ by part a.
\end{proof}
