Prove $\forall a,b,c \in \Z_{>0},\, c^2=ab,\, (a,b)=1 \implies a,b$ are perfect squares.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	We wish to show that all primes factors of $a$ and $b$ must have even powers, this implies that  $a$ and  $b$ are themselves perfect squares.

	Let the prime factorization of  $a$ and  $b$ be given respectively by  \[
		\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{\alpha_i}\text{ and } \prod_{j=1}^{m}q_j^{\beta_j}
		.\]

	So, by the commutativity of multiplication, \[
		ab =  \prod_{i=1}^{k}\prod_{j=1}^{m}p_i^{\alpha_i}q_j^{\beta_j}
		.\]

	Since $c^2=ab$, then the prime factorization of $ab$ must have only even exponents.

	So, whenever  $p_i = q_j$ for some  $i,j$, then  $\alpha_i+\beta_j$ must be even.

	But,  $(a,b)=1\implies a,b$ share no common factors.

	So, we will never have $p_i = q_j$ for any $i,j$.

	So, $\forall i,j$, $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_j$ must be even already.

	Since all exponents of the prime factors of  $a$ and  $b$ are even, then  $a$ and $b$ must be perfect squares.
