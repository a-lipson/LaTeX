Show $\chi_{\Q}$ is not Reimann integrable on [0,1].
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Consider any partition $P$ of the closed unit interval.
	Then, the lower sums $L_P \chi_{\Q}$ will be equal to infimum of zero, while the upper sums $U_P \chi_{\Q}$ will be equal to the supremum of one.
	Since the upper and lower sums do not converge, then the indicator function for the rationals is not Reimann integrable.

	Furthermore, from class, we have that $\chi_{\Q}$ is not Jordan measurable as the boundary $\partial{\chi_{\Q}} = \{x \in [0,1],\, x \in \R\setminus\Q\} $ does not have measure zero. Since the indicator set is not Jordan measurable, is it also not Reimann integrable.
\end{proof}
