\begin{problem}[3]
Let $f:U\longrightarrow\R,\, U\subset \R^{n}\,$ open. Show $\forall i,\,  \exists \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}:U\longrightarrow\R\,$ bounded $\implies f$ continuous on $U$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Since $U\subset \R^{n}$ and $\left|\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\right|\le c$,
	then we can apply problem (1) to each partial of $f$. Since $f$ is continuous in all component directions, it is also everywhere continuous.
\end{proof}
