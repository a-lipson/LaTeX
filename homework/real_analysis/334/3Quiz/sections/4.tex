Let $S\subset \R^{n}$ be compact. Suppose $C_i\subset S$ are nonempty and closed, and are nested, $C_1 \supset C_2 \supset \cdots$. Prove \[
	\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty}C_i \neq \O
	.\]
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	% Suppose, for a contradiction, that $\bigcap C_i = \O$. Then, there exists some $i_1<i_2$ where $C_{i_1}$ and  $C_{i_2}$ are disjoint. But, since all $C_i$ are nested, the only way for some  $C_{i_1}$ and  $C_{i_2}$ to be disjoint is if $C_{i_1}$ was empty. But, this contradicts the assumption that all $C_i$ were nonempty. Thus, by contradiction, the union over all  $C_i$ must be nonempty.

	% Since $S$ is compact then every sequence in $S$ has a convergent subsequence with a limit in $S$. 

	% Then, we must have a sequence $x_i\in C_i$ since 

	Let $U_i=C_i^c$, so each  $U_i$ is open.

	Suppose, for a contradiction, that  $\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty}C_i = \O $, then $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}U_i = \R^{n}$.

	So $\{U_i\} $ is an open cover of $S$, which has a finite subcover by compactness.

	Thus,  $\exists N$ such that $S\subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{N} U_i$, which implies $\bigcap_{i=1}^{N} C_i = \O$.

	But $C_i$ nested, so $C_n=\bigcap_{i=1}^{N} C_i = \O $, which is a contradiction.
