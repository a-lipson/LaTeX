\begin{problem}[4]
Let $S\subset \R^3$ be the surface defined by $(x^2 + y^2)z = 1,\, z\in [1,334]$ and oriented with normals pointing away from the $z$-axis.
Let  $E\subset \R^3$ be a regular domain bounded by  $S$ and  $z\in [1,334]$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Find a parametrization for $S$, and write an iterated integral which represents the flux  $\iint_S \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{S}$ where $\mathbf{F} = (0,0,z)$.
	\item  Find the volume of the region $E$.
	\item Let $\mathbf{G} = (\exp{(y^2)},\sin{(x^2)},z)$.
	      Find the vector surface integral $\iint_S \mathbf{G}\cdot d\mathbf{S}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	(a) We will parametrize $S$ with  $\mathbf{r}(u,v) = (u\cos{v},u\sin{v},\frac{1}{u^2})$ where $u\in [\frac{1}{\sqrt{334}}, 1]$ and $v\in [0,2\pi]$.

	So,
	\begin{align*}
		\mathbf{r}_u                   & = (\cos{v},\sin{v},\frac{-2}{u^3})                               \\
		\mathbf{r}_v                   & = (-u\sin{v},u\cos{v},0)                                         \\
		\mathbf{r}_u\times\mathbf{r}_v & = \left( \frac{-2}{u^2}\cos{v}, \frac{-2}{u^2}\sin{v}, u \right)
		.\end{align*}

	Since this normal vector has a positive $z$ component, it agrees with the given normals of $S$.

	Then,  $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(u,v)) = (0,0,\frac{1}{u^2})$, so $\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{u}\,du\,dv$.

	So, \[
		\int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{334}}}^{1} \frac{1}{u} \,du \,dv
		= 2\pi \log{u}\big\vert_{{(334)}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}^1
		= \pi\log 334
		.\]

	(b) We see that $\text{div}\,\mathbf{F} = 1$.
	So, by the divergence theorem, the volume of the region $E$ is given by the closed surface  $S'$, which is  $S$ combined with a top disk at $z=334$ with radius $\frac{1}{\sqrt{334}}$, $S_t$ with upward normals, and bottom disk at $z=1$ with radius 1, $S_b$ with downward normals.

	The parametrization of $S_t$ will have a fixed $z$ component of 334 and, as a disk with upward normals, a normal vector given by $(0,0,u)$.
	So, our vector surface integral in the field $\mathbf{F}$ will have an integrand $334u$.
	With a typical parametrization of a disk, our integral might look like $\int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{334}}} 334u \,du \,dv = \pi$.

	Similarly, $S_b$ will have an integrand of $-u$, due to having downward normals.
	Then, $\int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{1} -u \,du  \,dv = -\pi$.

	So, the flux contributed by $S_t$ and $S_b$ cancel, and we are left with the surface integral from (a),  $\pi\log 334$ as the volume of $E$.

	(c) Since $\text{div}\,\mathbf{G} = 1$, and $\mathbf{G}$ is defined everywhere on $E$, then, by the divergence theorem, the flux thru $S$ on  $\mathbf{G}$ is the same as in (a).
\end{proof}
