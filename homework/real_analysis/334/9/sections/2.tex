\begin{problem}[2]
Let $\textbf{F}:\R^2\longrightarrow\R^2$ be an everywhere continuous, path-independent vector field.
$\forall x \in \R^2$, set $f(\textbf{x})=\int_{0}^{\textbf{x}} \textbf{F}\cdot \,d\textbf{x}$ as the line integral on any piecewise $C^1$ path from 0 to $x$.

Prove $f:\R^2\longrightarrow\R$ is $C^1$ and satisfies  $\nabla f = \textbf{F}$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	Since $\textbf{F}$ is path-independent, then $f$ will be a well defined function regardless of the path chosen from 0 to  $x$.

	We will split the arbitrary $C^1$ path into vertical and horizontal components.

	So, considering a horizontal then vertical decomposition of the path, we have \[
		f(x,y)=\int_{0}^{x} \textbf{F}_1(t,0) \,dt + \int_{0}^{y} \textbf{F}_2(x,t) \,dt
		.\]

	Similarly, we can construct a vertical then horizontal decomposition, \[
		f(x,y)=\int_{0}^{y} \textbf{F}_2(0,t) \,dt + \int_{0}^{x} \textbf{F}_1(t,y) \,dt
		.\]

	We see that, if we take the $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ of the first form of $f$, the integral over the horizontal interval  $[0,x]$ will vanish, leaving, \[
		\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
		= \frac{d}{dy}\int_{0}^{y} \textbf{F}_2(x,t) \,dt
		= \textbf{F}_2(x,y)
		.\]

	Likewise, for the second form of $f$, the vertical integral will vanish, so  \[
		\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \textbf{F}_1(x,y)
		.\]

	So, we have shown that, by each component, $\nabla f = \textbf{F}$. Since each component of $\textbf{F}$ was continuous, then  $f$ as the sum of integrals of continuous functions  $\textbf{F}_1$ and  $\textbf{F}_2$ is also continuous.
\end{proof}
