\begin{problem}[2]
Let $E \subset \R^3$ be the region inside the surface $x^2 + y^2 + z^2=4$ and outside the surface $4x^2 + 4y^2 - z^2=1$.
Let the density of $E$ be given by  $f(x,y,z)=z^2$.
Write an iterated integral for the mass of $E$ using spherical coordinates.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
	The outside surface is a sphere of radius 2.
	The inside surface is a hyperboloid of one sheet with a minimum radius of $\frac{1}{2}$.

	We will proceed with spherical coordinates where the angle $\phi$ gives altitude and  $\theta$ gives azimuth.

	So, with  $r^2=x^2 + y^2$ as in cylindrical coordinates, we can form the spherical radius $\rho$ from the right triangle with the radius $r$ of any point projected onto the $xy$-plane, and the height  $z$.
	With  $z$ adjacent to the azimuth  $\phi$ and  $r$ opposite, we see that $z=\rho\cos\phi$ and $r=\rho\sin\phi$.
	But, with $x=r\cos\theta$ and $y=r\sin\theta$, we have $x=\rho\sin\phi\cos\theta$ and $y=\rho\sin\phi\sin\theta$.

	Now, we will parametrize the bounding surfaces as $\rho(\theta,\phi)$.
	The sphere has a constant radius of 2 and is given by $\rho=2$.
	The hyperboloid can be parametrized as follows: \begin{align*}
		4(x^2 + y^2) - z^2                       & = 1 \\
		4{(\rho\sin\phi)}^2 + {(\rho\cos\phi)}^2 & = 1 \\
		\rho^2(4\sin^2\phi-\cos^2\phi)           & = 1 \\
		\rho^2(5\sin^2\phi-1)                    & = 1 \\
		\rho=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5\sin^2\phi-1} }
		.\end{align*}

	Since we wish to parametrize all around the sphere and hyperboloid, we will let $\theta\in [0,2\pi]$.
	Next, we will find the intersection points of the bounding surfaces which will give us bounds for $\phi$.
	\begin{align*}
		2             & = {(5\sin^2\phi-1)}^{-\frac{1}{2}}    \\
		5\sin^2\phi-1 & = \frac{1}{4}                         \\
		\sin^2\phi    & = \frac{1}{4}                         \\
		\sin\phi      & =  \pm \frac{1}{2},\  \phi\in [0,\pi] \\
		\phi          & = -\frac{\pi}{6},\frac{\pi}{6}
		.\end{align*}
	So, $\phi\in \left[-\frac{\pi}{6},\frac{\pi}{6}\right]$.

	Then, the integrand $z^2$ in polar coordinates becomes $\rho\cos^2\phi$.
	With the Jacobian determinant for spherical coordinates, $\rho^2\sin\phi$, the mass of $E$ is given by  \[
		\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{-\frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{6}}\int_{{(5\sin^2\phi-1)}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}^{2}\rho^4\cos^2\phi\sin\phi  \,d\rho  \,d\phi  \,d\theta
		.\]
\end{proof}
