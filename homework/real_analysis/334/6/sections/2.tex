\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Show $D=\bigcup_{s>0}D_s$
	\item Prove $D_s$ closed and bounded for  $s>0$, and therefore compact.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of a]
	First, we will show that $\text{osc}(f,x) = 0 \implies f$ is continuous.
	So, with the given definition of oscillation, with $0<\delta\to 0$ and $\forall \epsilon>0$, then $ |y-z|<\delta \implies |f(y)-f(z)| =0<\epsilon$. So $f$ is uniformly continuous and therefore continuous on $D_0$.

	However, for $s>0$ and some $\epsilon > 0$, we have that $\text{osc}(f,x) \ge s > \epsilon$, so $f$ is discontinuous on $D_s$. Since  $D$ contains all $x$ for which  $f$ is discontinuous, it must contain  $D_s$ for all  $s$, which is  $\bigcup\limits_{s>0}D_s$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of b]
	Since $D_s$ is a subset of the bounded set $[a,b]$, then  $D_s$ is bounded as well.

	We will now consider the sets $T_{\delta} = \{x\ \mid\ \exists y,z \in B_{\delta}(x) \land |f(y)-f(z)|\ge s\} $ such that $\bigcap\limits_{\delta>0}T_{\delta}=D_s$.
	Then, for any convergent sequence $\{x_n\} \subset \bigcap\limits_{\delta>0} T_{\delta}$ with $x_n\to x$, we will show that $x$ belongs in the intersection as well.

	Suppose $\forall \delta>0$ and $ \{x_n\} \subset T_{\delta} $, then, even if $x \not\in K_{\delta}$, we will have $x \in T_{2\delta}$.
	% Then, certainly, $x \in \bigcap\limits_{\delta>0} T_{2\delta}$. 
	But, $T_{2\delta}\subset \bigcap\limits_{\delta>0} T_{\delta}$.
	So, $x$ must belong to the intersection $\bigcap\limits_{\delta>0} T_{\delta}$ whenever $x_n\to x$ and $\{x_n\}$ is a subset of the intersection as well.
	So, $D_s=\bigcap\limits_{\delta>0} T_{\delta}$ contains all of its limit points and is therefore closed.

	Since $D_s$ closed and bounded, it is also compact.
\end{proof}
