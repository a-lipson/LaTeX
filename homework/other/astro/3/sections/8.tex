\begin{problem}
What is the main physical driver for the difference between the molecules that Mars can retain and those that Ceres can retain?

Hint: if you could move Ceres to Mars' orbit, could it retain the same molecules as Mars?
\end{problem}

The difference in temperature was small, $324 - 238 = 86 \approx 0.36 * 238$, about a 36 percent increase from Ceres to Mars.

The more important factor was the escape speed for each of these bodies; Mars has nearly 10 times the escape velocity of Ceres as it is much larger and has a greater gravitational force.

So, if we moved Ceres to the distance of Mars' orbit at 1.5 AU, it would still probably not retain most, if not all, of the gasses.
