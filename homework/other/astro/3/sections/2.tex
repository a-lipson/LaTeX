  \begin{problem}
As calculated above, molecules in the Earth's atmosphere must achieve an average speed of 1,867 m/s for some to escape the atmosphere. Considering your answer to question 1, can the Earth hold an atmosphere of hydrogen? 
Explain your answer.   
  \end{problem}
Since the average velocity of hydrogen gas at earth's distance of 1 AU, $~2220$ m/s, 
is greater than $1867$ m/s, then the earth cannot hold an atmosphere of hydrogen.
