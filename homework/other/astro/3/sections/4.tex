\begin{problem}
As calculated above, molecules in the Earth's atmosphere must achieve an average speed of 1,867 m/s for some to escape the atmosphere. Considering your answer to question 3, can the Earth hold an atmosphere of nitrogen?
Explain your answer.
\end{problem}
Since the average velocity of nitrogen gas at earth's distance of 1 AU, 593 m/s, is less than 1867 m/s, then the earth can, and in fact does, hold an atmosphere of nitrogen.
